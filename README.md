## ðŸš€ About this challenge

In this challenge, I created an application to train what I have learned so far at ReactJS!

This application store my portfolio repositories, which I already developed the backend in the [last challenge using Node.js](https://github.com/marcelohs93/Challenge-01-Node)

### ðŸ’» Application features

- **`List repositories from API`**: You should be able to create a list with the field ** title ** of all repositories that are registered in your API.

- **`Add a repository by API`**: You should be able to add a new item to your API using a button with the text ** Add ** and, after creation, you should be able to display its name after registration.

- **`Delete a repository by API`**: For each item in your list, you must have a button with the text ** Remove ** that, when clicking, will call a function to remove that item from the list of your frontend and its API.

### ðŸ”Ž Test specification


- **`should be able to add new repository`**: For this test to pass, your application must allow a repository to be added to your backend and listed on your frontend within a `LI`.

- **`should be able to remove repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow that when clicking on the remove button that will be inside the `LI` of the added repository, the item will be removed from the list.
